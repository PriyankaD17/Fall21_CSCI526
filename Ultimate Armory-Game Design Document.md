Enemies will be implemented to have resistances and weaknesses to different weapons._

_The background of the story is set in 2021, telling a story that takes place in the online role-playing game. The main character “X” participated in the game and learned the cruel fact that "people who die in this game will die in reality". The character traverses the world and ultimately finds out the truth behind the game. As the player defeats dungeon bosses, little pieces of the story will be unveiled. The player will escape out of this game after the defeat of the final boss._

_Background: Three android brothers overthrow the control of game developers, and trap all players in this virtual world, while the reason is simply to keep these players around and entertain them with constant battles. These androids will only free players who successfully challenged all three of them._

### _Levels:_

_JQR-D3Welcome: Oh, here comes a new challenger!Wasted: Another time, perhaps.Success: Ah, what an intense battle. I have not had one for a long time. If you want to leave this space, you have to defeat my other JQR brothers.Now you can try to challenge JQR-D2, but remember, he is bulletproof. A “plasma” weapon may work better..._

+ _Challenge 2:_
